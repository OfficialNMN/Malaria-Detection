# Malaria-Detection using VGG-19

This Web Application is made using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning Techniques (VGG19) to predict whether the blood sample taken from the patient is infected or not. The trained model takes image of blood sample as an input from the flask server which gets converted into an array of pixels to recognise malaria parasite from human blood sample.
