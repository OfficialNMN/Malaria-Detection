# Malaria-Detection using VGG-19

This Web Application is made using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer Learning Techniques (VGG19) to predict whether the blood sample taken from the patient is infected or not. The trained model takes image of cell extracted from blood sample using medical techniques as an input from the flask server which gets converted into an array of pixels to recognise malaria parasite from human blood sample.

#### Model created is saved in a malaria_vgg.h5 file for further use.
#### WebApplication is to be created using Flask server as backend and HTML/CSS on frontend
